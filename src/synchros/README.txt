Motion capture <=> Force plate
Left foot      <=> 2
Right foot     <=> 1


put at least 2 corresponding points :
time in the force plate data (in sec) <=> index in the force plate data
If you used a jump or another routine with the feet for synchronization, you can launch the script "help_synchro" too plot the Z forces and the Z coordinate of the feet 

in the last row, put "t0" the beginning time of the motion after the synchronisation routine (the time is here expressed with t=0 in the motion capture time set)
